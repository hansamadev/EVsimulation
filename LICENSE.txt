                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free software license for software
  and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software are designed to
  take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
  General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
  and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its
  users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other software whose authors commit to
  using it.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
  To understand the concept, you should read the article *Free Software, Free
  Society*.

  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
  freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
  if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
  that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
  and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
  rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
  modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
  for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
  received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) they
  give you this License, and (2) they offer you a warranty of the software.
  The GNU GPL ensures that users have these rights in all copies of a GPL'd
  program, and every version of it.
